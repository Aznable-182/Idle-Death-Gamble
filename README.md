# Idle Death Gamble
This Project is a recreation of Kinji Hakari's Domain, from JJK
You may need to change how the program locates the music, do this by finding the music file in your directory and copy the address,
then paste that into the code on lines 61, 131, and 134. This should allow you to change the music, and for the program to actually run.

The probabilities of his domain are a combination of what i felt was right, and manga accuracy; Hakari has never not hit a domain in 7 tries,
so on the 7th try, the domain will activate no matter what
